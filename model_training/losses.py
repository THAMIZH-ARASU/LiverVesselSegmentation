Loss functions for medical image segmentation tasks. Implements cross-entropy loss with optional class weighting for handling class imbalance in segmentation datasets.

This module provides loss functions specifically designed for segmentation tasks,
supporting both standard cross-entropy and weighted variants for imbalanced datasets.
